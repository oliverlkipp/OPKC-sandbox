# Open Pathogen Kinetics Commons: the viral kinetics database

This repository contains software to combine data from multiple studies into a single viral kinetics database. 

## Quick start

### Virtual environment setup (once)
This project uses `venv` to manage package versions. After cloning this project to your local machine, navigate to the root directory (`gvkl/`) and run the following from the command line: 

`$ python3 -m venv venv`

Next, activate the virtual environment: 

`source venv/bin/activate`

Install all the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Last (important!!), add `venv/` and `.env` to your `.gitignore` file (create one in your local `gvkl/` directory if you don't have one yet) 

```
# .gitignore
venv/
.env
```

### Virtual environment management (every time you open the code) 

Be sure to re-activate the virtual environment: 

`source venv/bin/activate`

### Data processing 

To ingest the data, format it, and generate the database, run 

```
$ python3 code/ingest_studies/create_schema.py
```

A helper script for testing the ingestion of individual studies before integrating them into the full database is also available: 

```
$ python3 code/ingest_studies/test_import.py
```

## Phase I progress

### Ingesting studies

## Phase II Work Plan
