# Overview
This directory contains data ingested from the literature. Logged in "main_lit_list.md" are the data sources. As contributors identify literature, they should make sure this list is kept up to date.

## Literature Workflow
In the "Status" column of main_lit_list, users can indicate what stage of the literature worflow a given reference is in, and either add new papers to the list or work on scanning or ingesting already identified papers.

### 1. **Identify** a candidate paper
- Check main_lit_list for the DOI to ensure that it hasn't already been processed, and if not, add it.
- Recommended avenues of search are:
    - Specific journals (e.g. Epidemics, Human Challenge Studies for Vaccine Development)
    - Authors (e.g. Christopher Chiu, works from senior authors on already identified papers)
    - Methods or topics (e.g. challange studies, epi review papers)


### 2. **Scan** paper for pathogen kinetics data to quickly determin if that data exists or not.
- Annotate in main_lit_list according to the below scheme. (Emojis are for easy labeling in Slack.)
    - DE ✅ = data exists
	- DE-NEA ✳️ = not easily accessible
	    - as in the data is clearly there at individual scale but would need to be extracted or requested
    - DME ❇️ = data may exist, worth following up more in-depth
        - as in would definitely need to request, and figures do not display individual resolution
    - NA ❎ = not applicable, not something we can use for whatever reason
    - MO 🤖 = modeling only
    - DAI = data already included
    	- e.g. data from this source has already been included as part of another dataset
    	- these references are recorded to prevent redundant scanning
- A quick way to find papers with easily accessible data for us is by searching within the paper text for "github", "Zenodo" or "Dryad"
- Other metadata worth noting:
	- pathogen(s), any variant info
    - XS 🌐 = cross-sectional data (may be of use for model parameters, but isn't individual-level empirical data itself)
	- readout(s)
		- symptoms, titers, etc.
        - sx 🤧 = symptom trajectory information
    - MA ♻️ = paper is a review or meta-analysis
	- time resolution and duration
		- year(s) data collected?
	- patient/participant population
	- interventions/drugs/treatments
		- e.g. challenge, neutralization, etc.
	- any infection or transmission data?
	- study design/sampling notes
	- first and relevant senior authors

### 3. **Ingest** the data from that source and save it to this directory
- Any papers with status Scanned: DE can be immediately ingested. Other designations will need more work.

Tentatively we're using DIGEST to distinguish those papers that have data saved here AND have scripts written to clean and format the data up to our standards.

## Challenges and nuances of note
- identifying empirical vs. modeled data
- want to capture linkages between papers
	- e.g. modeling papers based on empirical data
- papers with many authors can be challenging to identify who the senior author is to seed future searches on
